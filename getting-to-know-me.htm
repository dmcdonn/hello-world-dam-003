<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Hi! My name is Delaney McDonnell, I am a senior at Lewis University. I major in Criminal Justice and I minor in Cyber Security. I have two older sisters both of which have their masters degrees one in teaching and the other in business finance.
My dad is an electrician and my mom is a human rescources manager at a company.I have always been the athlete of the family. I have played essentially every sport at some point in my life, but the sport
I played for the longest time was soccer which I played for fourteen years. Here at Lewis, I am one of the team captains for the archery club and last semester I was in choir. I also play a ridiculous amount of video games whenever I have the opportunity.
I usually play on Xbox with a few of my friends, but I do also have a nintendo switch, as well as a Playstation 4. If I am not playing video games, I am probably working out or out hiking somewhere.</p

<h4>My Favorite Hobby</h4>
<p>My favorite hobby I'd have to say is painting or drawing. Whenever I have the opportunity I am painting. It just helps me relieve stress and relax a little. I have never taken any
painting classes or any art classes for that matter, so I am self-taught. I also really like hiking and just being outside in general which is probably why a lot of my paintings have something
to do with nature.</p>

<h4>Fun Fact</h4>
<p>One fun fact about me is that I go to Florida every year to hangout with my grandma. I have been going since I was a around five years old, and last year was the first year I was sent by myself 
    without my family or anyone else to hangout with. Also, I have never broken a bone or even fractured one even though I have played soccer for so many years and I definitely am ridculously reckless. The 
    worst injury I hvae had due to soccer was a concussion and a sprained ankle.</p>
